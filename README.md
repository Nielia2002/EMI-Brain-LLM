🚀 NeuraShield AI 🧠⚡️

NeuraShield AI is an advanced AI-powered diagnostic system designed to detect and classify electromagnetic interference (EMI) signals and accurately predict brain cancer types using state-of-the-art machine learning models. 🌐🔬

📖 Overview

NeuraShield AI integrates sophisticated neural network models to provide fast, accurate predictions in two crucial areas:
- **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)** 📡: Classifies EMI signals (e.g., Arcing, Corona, MicroSparking).
- **Brain Cancer Diagnosis** 🧠: Predicts specific brain cancer types with high precision.

✨ Key Features

• **High Accuracy Models** 🎯
• **Weighted Training** ⚖️ (to handle class imbalance)
• **Real-time Classification** ⏳
• **Interactive LLM-based Reports** 🤖📝
• **Easy Integration & Scalability** 🔧

📂 Project Structure

- `emi_model.py`: EMI signal classification using a CNN.
- `brain_model.py`: Brain cancer type prediction using an MLP.
- `generate_report.py`: AI-generated diagnostic report using Hugging Face LLM.
- Datasets stored in CSV files 📊
