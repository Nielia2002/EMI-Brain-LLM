The EMI classification results indicate a high prevalence of electrical interference in the system, with the most common types being Corona (241 samples), PartialDischarge (267 samples), and ProcessNoise (270 samples).\n","    - The Normal class, which represents the absence of electrical interference, is the least common class (235 samples).\n","\n","    Significance of Results:\n","    - The high occurrence of Corona, PartialDischarge, and ProcessNoise suggests that there may be significant electrical arcing, discharge, and noise in the system, which could potentially lead to equipment failure, system downtime, and safety hazards.\n","    - The low number of Normal samples indicates that the electrical system is not operating optimally, as it should have a higher proportion of samples classified as Normal.\n","\n","    Recommended Actions:\n","    - Immediate investigation and repair of the electrical system is recommended to address the high levels of electrical interference.\n","    - Implement preventive maintenance measures to reduce the occurrence of electrical arcing, discharge, and noise.\n","    - Regular monitoring of the electrical system to ensure its continued optimal operation and to identify any potential issues early.\n","\n","    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","    Brain Cancer Diagnostic Report\n","\n","    Summary of Findings:\n","    - The brain cancer prediction results show a relatively even distribution of the four types of brain cancer, with Glioma (37 samples) being the most common, followed by Meningiomas (31 samples), Germinoma (46 samples), and Pituitary Adenoma (26 samples).\n","\n","    Significance of Results:\n","    - The presence of any type of brain cancer is a serious concern and requires immediate medical attention.\n","    - The relatively even distribution of the four types of brain cancer suggests that further investigation is needed to understand the underlying causes and risk factors for each type of cancer.\n","\n","    Recommended Actions:\n","    - The patient should be referred to a neurologist or neurosurgeon for further evaluation and treatment.\n","    - Additional diagnostic tests, such as MRI or CT scans, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the cancer.\n","    - Genetic testing may be considered to identify any genetic predispositions to brain cancer.\n","    - Lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, may be recommended to reduce the risk of brain cancer recurrence.\n","    - Regular follow-up appointments with the neurologist or neurosurgeon are essential to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary.\n","\n"," Report saved as 'ai_diagnostic_report.txt'!\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient\n","\n","# Define mappings from numeric labels to descriptive names\n","emi_class_mapping = {\n","    0: \"Arcing\",\n","    1: \"Corona\",\n","    2: \"DataModulation\",\n","    3: \"Exciter\",\n","    4: \"MicroSparking\",\n","    5: \"Normal\",\n","    6: \"PartialDischarge\",\n","    7: \"ProcessNoise\",\n","    8: \"RandomNoise\"\n","}\n","\n","brain_class_mapping = {\n","    0: \"Pituitary Adenoma\",\n","    1: \"Germinoma\",\n","    2: \"Meningiomas\",\n","    3: \"Glioma\"\n","}\n","\n","# Set USE_LOCAL_MODEL flag as before\n","USE_LOCAL_MODEL = False  #the Hugging Face API\n","\n","# Authenticate using your token (you can also set it as an environment variable)\n","token = os.environ.get(\"HF_TOKEN\", \"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\")\n","client = InferenceClient(model=\"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\", token=token)\n","\n","def load_classification_results():\n","    \"\"\"Loads classification results and maps numeric labels to descriptive names.\"\"\"\n","    try:\n","        # EMI Results: Map numeric labels to names\n","        emi_results = pd.read_csv(\"/content/emi_classification_results.csv\")\n","        emi_results[\"Predicted_Label\"] = emi_results[\"Predicted_Label\"].map(emi_class_mapping)\n","        emi_summary_df = emi_results.groupby(\"Predicted_Label\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n","        emi_summary = \"\\n\".join([f\"{row['Predicted_Label']}: {row['Count']} samples\" for index, row in emi_summary_df.iterrows()])\n","\n","        # Brain Cancer Results: Map numeric labels to names\n","        brain_results = pd.read_csv(\"/content/brain_cancer_classification_results.csv\")\n","        brain_results[\"Predicted_Label\"] = brain_results[\"Predicted_Label\"].map(brain_class_mapping)\n","        brain_summary_df = brain_results.groupby(\"Predicted_Label\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n","        brain_summary = \"\\n\".join([f\"{row['Predicted_Label']}: {row['Count']} samples\" for index, row in brain_summary_df.iterrows()])\n","\n","        return emi_summary, brain_summary\n","\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Error loading classification results: {e}\")\n","        return \"No EMI results found.\", \"No Brain Cancer results found.\"\n","\n","\n","def generate_llm_report():\n","    emi_summary, brain_summary = load_classification_results()\n","\n","    prompt = f\"\"\"\n","    You are a seasoned diagnostic expert in both electrical engineering and medical imaging.\n","\n","    Based on the classification results provided below, please generate a professional diagnostic report.\n","\n","    EMI Classification Results (Electrical Interference):\n","    {emi_summary}\n","    -
